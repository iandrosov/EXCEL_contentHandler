EXCEL_contentHandler
====================

WebMethods Integration Server content handler for MS Excel based on Apache POI.
This content handler is based on apache POI API to read MS Excel data files and convert binary data into records in WM Integration server to enable Excel based integrations. 

This package was originally created for WebMethods IS 4.x and updated to 6.x version.
Apache POI version 1[2].5.1-final. This older jar file is included for connivence.

Note: that this package may not build with newer POI library versions due to changes in Apache POI Workbook/Sheet API in later versions.
